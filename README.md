# ðŸ“Š Repo Analyzer

**Repo Analyzer** is a full-stack web application that helps researchers identify, sample, and analyze open-source repositories from GitHub.

It provides tools to:

- Search and filter repositories using the GitHub Search API
- Generate statistically valid random samples
- Enrich repository metadata (e.g. code coverage rates)

The goal is to simplify and automate the process of preparing open-source repositories for empirical software engineering research.
